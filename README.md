Use this app to take in time and out time to display total hours worked in decimal format rounded to the second decimal place

This app will store the hours in a Core Data database, as well as let you see how many hours are stored and the total of the hours stored

It also has various customization options to make the app suit your needs.

I created this app in order to help me calculate my hours at work.
